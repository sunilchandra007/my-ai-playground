# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**RAG** is a technique used in AI systems to enhance the quality and relevance of generated responses by combining two key components:

## üîç 1. Retrieval
- The system searches external sources (e.g., databases, document stores, web pages) to find relevant information based on the user's query.
- This step ensures that the model has access to **up-to-date** and **domain-specific** knowledge.

## ‚úçÔ∏è 2. Generation
- A language model (like GPT) uses the retrieved information along with the original query to generate a coherent and contextually accurate response.
- This allows the model to go beyond its internal training data and produce more informed outputs.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of RAG
- **Improves accuracy** by grounding responses in real data.
- **Reduces hallucinations** (i.e., made-up or incorrect information).
- **Supports dynamic knowledge** that changes over time (e.g., news, regulations).
- **Enables enterprise use cases** by integrating with internal knowledge bases.

## üß† RAG vs. Traditional LLMs
| Feature               | Traditional LLMs | RAG                          |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Knowledge Source     | Pretrained model | External + pretrained model |
| Freshness of Data    | Static           | Dynamic                      |
| Domain Adaptability  | Limited          | High                         |
| Hallucination Risk   | Higher           | Lower                        |

## üîó Use Cases
- Customer support using internal documentation
- Legal or medical advice based on verified sources
- Enterprise search and Q&A
- Technical troubleshooting with product manuals

## üß© RAG in Microsoft Copilot Platform (MCP)
- MCP uses **grounding** to connect LLMs to trusted enterprise data.
- RAG is often part of this grounding strategy, enabling Copilot to retrieve and use real-time, contextual information.
- Rather than replacing RAG, MCP **enhances** it with orchestration, plugins, and secure data access.
